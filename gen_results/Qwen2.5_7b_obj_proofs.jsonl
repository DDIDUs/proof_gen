Since `throwError` is a simple function that wraps its argument in an `Inl`, the main challenge is to understand how `corres_underlyingK` behaves under these conditions.\n\nGiven that `corres_underlyingK` is a relational property, we need to ensure that the relations on both sides of the correspondence hold. The key here is to recognize that `throwError a` and `throwError b` are simply wrapping `a` and `b` in `Inl`.\n\nSince the lemma does not provide explicit definitions for `sr`, `nf`, `nf'`, and `r`, we cannot proceed further without additional information. However, based on the structure of the lemma, we can infer that the goal simplifies to checking the equality of the results of applying `throwError` to the inputs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe subgoals remain as they are because we lack sufficient information about the definitions of `sr`, `nf`, `nf'`, and `r`. To complete the proof, we would need more details about these constants and how they interact with `corres_underlyingK`.\n\nThus, the subgoals are:\n\n1. ```isabelle\n   corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' (r (Inl a) (Inl b)) r \\<top> \\<top> (throwError a) (throw b)\n   ```\n\n2. ```isabelle\n   corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' (r (Inl a) (Inl b)) r \\<top> \\<top> (throwError a) (throwError b)\n   ```\n\nThese subgoals require further analysis based on the actual definitions of `sr`, `nf`, `nf'`, and `r`.", "cot_output": "```isabelle\nlemma corres_throwError_str [corresK_concrete_rER]:\n  \"corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' (r (Inl a) (Inl b)) r \\<top> \\<top> (throwError a) (throw b)\"\n  \"corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' (r (Inl a) (Inl b)) r \\<top> \\<top> (throwError a) (throwError b)\"\n  unfolding throwError_def\n  by (auto simp: corres_underlyingK_def)\n```", "fs_baseline_output": "```isabelle\nlemma corres_throwError_str [corresK_concrete_rER]:\n  \"corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' (r (Inl a) (Inl b)) r \\<top> \\<top> (throwError a) (throw b)\"\n  \"corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' (r (Inl a) (Inl b)) r \\<top> \\<top> (throwError a) (throwError b)\"\n  by (auto simp: throwError_def corres_underlyingK_def)\n```", "fs_cot_sketch": "The given lemma does not involve an explicitly recursive datatype like lists or natural numbers, nor does it seem to be naturally suited for induction based on its structure.

Since these constants are not defined in the provided context, we will treat them as opaque.\n\n2. **Simplify the Goal**: After unfolding the definitions, we need to simplify the goal to see if there are any obvious simplifications or contradictions.\n\nSince the lemma is straightforward and does not involve any complex logic or recursion, the goal simplifies directly without the need for induction.\n\n### Subgoals:\n\nThere are no subgoals because the lemma is already in its simplest form.

This is a vacuous truth since the antecedent `(F \\<Longrightarrow> corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' F r Q Q' f g)` is always false unless `F` is false.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **LHS**: `(F \\<Longrightarrow> corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' F r Q Q' f g)`\n  - This part of the goal asserts that if `F` is true, then `corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' F r Q Q' f g` holds.\n\n- **RHS**: `corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' F r Q Q' f g`\n  - This part of the goal simply states that `corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' F r Q Q' f g` holds.\n\nSince the antecedent `(F \\<Longrightarrow> corres_underlyingK sr nf nf' F r Q Q' f g)` is always false unless `F` is false, the entire implication is true regardless of the truth value of `F`.

Specifically, the assumption `z` provides the necessary correspondence for each pair `(x, y)` in `S`, and the assumption `w` ensures that `P` and `P'` are preserved under the application of `f` and `f'`.\n\nThus, the subgoals are straightforward to handle without further induction.", "fs_cot_output": "```isabelle\nlemma corresK_mapM:\n  assumes S: \"set (zip xs ys) \\<subseteq> S\"\n  assumes z: \"\\<And>x y. corres_protect ((x, y) \\<in> S) \\<Longrightarrow> corres_underlyingK R nf nf' (F x y) r' P P' (f x) (f' y)\"\n  assumes w: \"\\<And>x y.

We will unfold these definitions and simplify the goal.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Simplification:\n\n1. **Unfold `F_all2_def`:**\n   ```isabelle\n   F_all2 :: \"('a \\<Rightarrow> 'b \\<Rightarrow> bool) \\<Rightarrow> 'a list \\<Rightarrow> 'b list \\<Rightarrow> bool\"\n   F_all2 f [] [] = True\n   F_all2 f (x#xs) (y#ys) = f x y \\<and> F_all2 f xs ys\n   ```\n\n2. **Substitute `F_all2` in the goal:**\n   ```isabelle\n   F xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> \\<exists>F'.

The definition of `list_all2` is:\n\n```isabelle\ndefinition list_all2 :: \"('a \\<Rightarrow> 'b \\<Rightarrow> bool) \\<Rightarrow> 'a list \\<Rightarrow> 'b list \\<Rightarrow> bool\" where\n  \"list_all2 P xs ys = (length xs = length ys \\<and> list_all2' P xs ys)\"\n```\n\nAnd the definition of `list_all2'` is:\n\n```isabelle\nfun list_all2' :: \"('a \\<Rightarrow> 'b \\<Rightarrow> bool) \\<Rightarrow> 'a list \\<Rightarrow> 'b list \\<Rightarrow> bool\" where\n  \"list_all2' _ [] [] = True\"\n| \"list_all2' P (x # xs) (y # ys) = (P x y \\<and> list_all2' P xs ys)\"\n| \"list_all2' _ _ _ = False\"\n```\n\nNow, let's substitute these definitions into our lemma:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"(length xs = length ys \\<and> list_all2' (\\<lambda>x y. Q x y \\<and> P x y) xs ys) \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys\"\n```\n\nNext, we apply the definition of `list_all2'` to the premise:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"(length xs = length ys \\<and> (length xs = length ys \\<and> list_all2' Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2' P xs ys)) \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys\"\n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"(length xs = length ys \\<and> list_all2' Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2' P xs ys) \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys\"\n```\n\nSince `length xs = length ys` appears twice in the premise, we can simplify further:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"list_all2' Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2' P xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys\"\n```\n\nNow, we need to show that `list_all2' Q xs ys` implies `list_all2 Q xs ys` and `list_all2' P xs ys` implies `list_all2 P xs ys`.\n\nFor `list_all2' Q xs ys`:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"list_all2' Q xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys\"\n```\n\nFor `list_all2' P xs ys`:\n\n```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"list_all2' P xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 P xs ys\"\n```\n\nThese subgoals are straightforward because `list_all2'` is defined recursively, and each recursive call checks the head elements and then proceeds with the tail elements. Since `Q` and `P` are applied to the same elements, the subgoals reduce to checking that `Q` and `P` hold for all elements in the lists.\n\nSo, the final subgoals are:\n\n1. ```isabelle\n   list_all2' Q xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys\n   ```\n\n2. ```isabelle\n   list_all2' P xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 P xs ys\n   ```\n\nThese subgoals can be proved by structural induction on the lists `xs` and `ys`.", "fs_cot_output": "```isabelle\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"list_all2' Q xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 Q xs ys\"\n  by (induct xs ys rule: list_all2'.induct)\n     (auto simp: list_all2_def)\n\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"list_all2' P xs ys \\<Longrightarrow> list_all2 P xs ys\"\n  by (induct xs ys rule: list_all2'.induct)\n     (auto simp: list_all2_def)\n\nlemma list_all2_conjD:\n  \"list_all2' (\\<lambda>x y.

P x x) xs\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Simplify Using Definitions**:\n   - For `list_all2 P xs xs`, consider two cases based on the length of `xs`:\n     - Case 1: `xs = []`\n       ```isabelle\n       list_all2 P [] [] = True\n       ```\n     - Case 2: `xs = x#xs`\n       ```isabelle\n       list_all2 P (x#xs) (y#ys) = (P x y \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys)\n       ```\n   - For `list_all (\\<lambda>x.

The definition of `list_all2` is typically something like:\n\n```isabelle\ndefinition list_all2 :: \"('a \\<Rightarrow> 'b \\<Rightarrow> bool) \\<Rightarrow> 'a list \\<Rightarrow> 'b list \\<Rightarrow> bool\" where\n  \"list_all2 P [] [] = True\"\n| \"list_all2 P (x#xs) (y#ys) = (P x y \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys)\"\n| \"list_all2 P _ _ = False\"\n```\n\nNow, let's unfold the definition of `list_all`.

Let's break it down:\n\n   - Left-hand side: `(P x y \\<and> list_all2 P xs ys)`\n   - Right-hand side: `(list_all (\\<lambda>x. P x x) (x#xs))`\n\n   We know that `list_all` for a non-empty list `(x#xs)` is `P x \\<and> list_all P xs`. So, we can rewrite the right-hand side as:\n\n   ```isabelle\n   (P x \\<and> list_all P xs) = (list_all (\\<lambda>x.

Since `ys'' = xs''`, this simplifies to:\n   ```isabelle\n   ∀xs''. xs'' ⊆ set xs \\<longrightarrow> (∃ys''. ys'' = xs'' \\<and> ∀x y. (x, y) ∈ xs'' \\<longrightarrow> F x y xs'' xs'')\n   ```\n\n5. **Final Simplification**: The final subgoal is:\n   ```isabelle\n   ∀xs''. xs'' ⊆ set xs \\<longrightarrow> (∃ys''. ys'' = xs'' \\<and> ∀x y. (x, y) ∈ xs'' \\<longrightarrow> F x y xs'' xs'')\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **LHS**: The left-hand side of the implication is `∀xs''. xs'' ⊆ set xs`. This means for every subset `xs''` of `set xs`, there exists some `ys''` such that `ys'' = xs''` and for all pairs `(x, y) ∈ xs''`, `F x y xs'' ys''` holds.\n  \n- **RHS**: The right-hand side of the implication is `∃ys''. ys'' = xs'' ∧ ∀x y. (x, y) ∈ xs'' ⟶ F x y xs'' ys''`. This means there exists some `ys''` equal to `xs''` such that for all pairs `(x, y) ∈ xs''`, `F x y xs'' ys''` holds.\n\nSince `ys'' = xs''` and `xs'' ⊆ set xs`, the condition `F x y xs'' ys''` simplifies to `F x y xs'' xs''`, which is trivially true because `xs''` is a subset of itself.\n\nThus, the subgoal is immediate by simp.", "fs_cot_output": "```isabelle\nlemma F_all2_eq:\n  \"(\\<And>x xs'. x \\<in> set xs \\<Longrightarrow> set xs' \\<subseteq> set xs \\<Longrightarrow> F x x xs' xs') \\Longrightarrow> F_all2 F xs xs\"\n  apply (simp add: F_all2_def)\n  apply (rule_tac x=\"\\<lambda>x y. x \\<in> set xs \\<and> x = y\" in exI)\n  apply (intro conjI impI allI)\n  apply (drule list_all2_conjD)\n  apply (simp add: list.rel_eq)\n  apply (simp add: list_all2_to_list_all list_all_mem_subset)\n  apply (rule list.rel_refl_strong; simp)\n  done\n```"}
